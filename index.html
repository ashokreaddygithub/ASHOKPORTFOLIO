Through this course, I have learned about fundamental language of python and why is do demanding. The main reason behind using python is that it is data science and stand out to be most demanding language in present day. Python is popular so much because it comes up with simplified syntax and not complicated one. Due to this nature, it provides much emphasize on natural language. The aspect of ease of learning and usage allow python codes to be written and executed in much faster than the other programming languages. After learning python, it is very much easy to get job. Python is very much popular within machine learning due to the presence of various libraries. This programming language do provide best solution in key areas ranging from data science and machine learning. The language does come up with enormous community and thereby fulfill the ongoing requirement of developers. The language has become popular in the domain of data science and machine learning which stand out to be key drivers. It is also expected that there can be growth of this language by checking individual tags. Python do come up with bright future where language for developers is engaging with machine learning projects. The companies are looking for purpose of scaling up for using big data analytics and related efforts. I hope that in upcoming years, the job growth would increase in between 2019 and 2029. </p>

            <h4>Morgan, J. (2020). Electric vehicles: the future we made and the problem of unmaking it. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 44(4), 953-977.</h4>
            <p>The overstatement of the efficiency of electric cars has been a problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, a number of companies were at the front of electric car manufacturers. The creation of a longer cell that could store enough fuel to produce electric vehicles practicable proved to be a hurdle to the development of the electric car. The first electric cars appeared in the late 1800s. Because of their expensive price, limited speed, and short range, they didn't fare well in the market before. As a result, at first, there was a global fall in demand. But they have been utilized for access to public transport transit, notably as rail vehicles. Internal combustion automobiles had a competitive advantage in the early years of the twentieth century because of the underdevelopment of electric-operated cars. Because of the ten-year head start that internal combustion cars had over electrically powered vehicles, the latter had not been able to recover. Internal combustion engine-powered cars saw a significant increase in sales, which allowed for improved efficiency in combustion engines to be developed.</p>
            <p>After waiting for a battery cell for five years, consumers lost faith in the electric car industry. Electricity would last for 200 miles on Edison's battery, according to the inventor. An electric car that could go 100 miles on a single charge and cost the user on average $8 hundred dollars was developed in 1914 by cooperation between Henry Ford and Thomas Edison.</p>
            <p>It was argued that electric car manufacturing was influenced significantly by expectations. Although new technology was constantly being developed, the electric car producer had to convince prospective purchasers that there was no modern tech coming. Assuring purchasers that their purchases would not become outdated was a necessary step in the process. The problems with the battery cells were left unsolved for another day. Due to the need for an electric starting, Henry Ford enlisted the help of Thomas Edison. In 1919, Ford invented the electric starter for their automobiles. Many would-be car buyers choose to buy a vehicle with internal combustion because of the five-year wait for the development of a suitable energy battery bank. There were a large number of prospective buyers who did not acquire any vehicles.</p>
            <p>In my perspective, the paper focuses much too much on the technical issues surrounding internal combustion engines without examining the business motivations for their promotion. The need that fuel cell and battery technology to be developed in order to meet the rigorous requirements of automotive propulsion usage is one of the most important impediments to the manufacture of electric cars. The paper detailed the number of studies that had already been done. The paper, on the other hand, only considered one alternative: nickel-iron battery cells. There were no considerations of current technology, such as the widespread use of lithium ferric phosphate batteries in contemporary devices.</p>
            <p>An appropriate power cell had to be developed, and this resulted in significant expenses. The Edison company's research and development was six years behind schedule. The costly development of advanced items necessitates rapid revenues for many businesses. Stakeholders expect companies to react. The lack of progress in the creation of energy cells for electric batteries might be attributed to a need for fast profits.</p>

                <p>As stated by Nagy, (2020), direct quotation can be used sparingly, but when they are used then they can work as the most powerful tool. The updated rules state that use of long quotes whenever possible can be seen for longer than three lines. Whenever quotes are used, then they are used for providing some indisputable kind of evidence to the incredible claim. Direct quotation from the source can reveal that audience can exactly say that sources are not anyhow suspicious. Communication is best idea which provide a unique and dynamic method. Here passages need to be quoted if anyhow the source clearly explain the best possible original method either working of striking. Direct quotation work as the passage used for analysis purpose. If anyhow the author is going analyze the passage or quote, then exactly new words need to be included prior to follow up the analysis. On the contrary, paraphrasing allows the author with an opportunity for tailor the passage regarding the essay. This is not always feasible by making use of direct quote. Simplify the passage would become difficult for understanding the whole thing. This can be any fine topic where author may have made use of language which again complicates the topic. Paraphrasing do provide an option to author to clarify the passage where audience can have better understanding of idea. This also establishes a connection to the point of paraphrasing a difficult passage where author can establish trust with audience. Lastly, paraphrasing provides an option to maintain the flow of writing.</p>

                <p>According to Hasanah & Fatimah, (2020), writing do provide an option for making use of ideas from other available sources. There are some times where it can become best for quoting this from direct sources. It can be served by paraphrasing or creating suitable summary. Direct quotation is useful at the instance of exact wording from the statement which is also important. The exact wording used in quotation which stand out to be bit significant in the claim. It is also found to be vital at the instance of making sure of precise in representing the position of author. The author review quotation as tool for highlight detail meaning, clarification and support the text being put within quotes. It is useful in providing some detail information regarding the quoted work either in positive or negative way. Quotation works as the best method which involve some key respect to author of work and thereby creating some compliance with laws related to copyright. It is borrowed solely for the purpose of the review. Some of the famous quotations are used as tool for inspiring people for deep thinking for reader. At the instance of paraphrasing, it is to be seen that there are many words and phares not being considered from the original text. So, both the terms paraphrasing and quotation need to be intertwined for coming up with an effective and though provoking work. </p>

            <p>Research databases do aim to offer user for getting access to thousands of magazines, books, images, chart, and primary sources. The identified database does comprise of some scholarly and peer-reviewed articles being written using credible author like researchers and expert within the domain (UMOSO, 2021). As databases do allow some powerful searching tools used for narrowing results. Here users can quickly move and find the required information needed. </p>
            <p> An application tracking software is best software used for recruiting and employers make use of this for tracking down candidates within hiring and recruiting process. This software can be easily equipped with certain capabilities do range from simple database functionality to full-time services. This tool makes it much easy for various business of any size so they can filter, manage, and thereby analyzed candidates (Lindström, 2018). The article emphasizes on use of applicant tracking system which stand out to be unique to companies. But here each one can thrive for attracting, hiring and maximizing the top talent. Most of the business do encounter some sort of challenges at some point within case of hiring onboarding process. The fact should be noted an ATS can be offered with range of capabilities which can ultimately help involved companies to find, hire and thereby retain the best candidates. </p>
            <p>The dependency on manual process, poor collaboration can be seen with recruitment team and miscommunication with some of the hiring stakeholders. It helps in revealing that applicants do move slow rate by making use of hiring process (Banshwar et al., 2021). This applicant tracking system do create some opportunities for automating manual process, enhance visibility into the hiring cycle for the whole recruitment team. All this can ultimately enhance opportunity where communication can be considered within candidate journey. </p>
            <p>Recruit ahead of the curve by establishment of structured hiring process. Building an effective talent pipeline, source candidate can allow candidate even much faster than ever. This can harness overall power of data and provide a much great deal candidate experience. Right form identifying talent to mapping behavioral assessment of candidates. Selected right talent with an AI-powered recruiting assistant (UMOSO, 2021). Effectively plans can workdays, even on your commute. Managing candidate, client, and contacts effortlessly and scheduling an interview on tap. The future companies will be based on attracting top talent in present situation. The key focus is on accessing swaths for talent pool with present with application tracking software. All this aim in enhance the overall quality of employees and hiring referrals. </p>
            <p>An ATS tracking system do provides a range of solutions for meeting up the hiring challenges encountered by recruiters (Lindström, 2018). This do range from sourcing to analyzing to selecting the best available candidate applicant tracking system which can help in enhancing experience of candidate. </p>
